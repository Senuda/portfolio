                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Iâ€™m Senuda Thinal Silva, a passionate Software Engineering undergraduate at SLIIT Academy and a
                    part-time developer. My technical skills include Java, HTML, WordPress, and SQL with foundational
                    database knowledge, with a strong interest in front-end development. I enjoy building clean,
                    responsive, and user-friendly interfaces that bring ideas to life on the web.

                    During my 8-month internship program, I contributed to several website projects, focusing mainly on
                    front-end development. This experience gave me practical exposure to building functional user
                    interfaces, working in collaborative teams, and applying industry best practices.

                    While my strength lies in the front-end, I am actively expanding my knowledge in databases and
                    full-stack development. I am open to working on diverse website and software projects, eager to
                    learn from experienced developers, and determined to specialize in areas where I can make the most
                    impact.

                    What I may lack in experience, I make up for with hard work, adaptability, and a continuous drive to
                    learn. My long-term goal is to become a versatile developer who can contribute to impactful projects
                    and create meaningful digital solutions.</p>
